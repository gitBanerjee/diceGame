This is a simple dice game between two players.
Here you have to roll the dice and then you can either add on the dice values or hold it to the your final score. If you want to keep on adding more values just keep on rolling the dice. If you want to hold the score then click on Hold Button below the Roll Dice Button but then the control will go to the other player.
Beware if you get 1 then all your added current score will turn to zero and control goes to the next player.
Whoever gets to 100 score first wins the game.
Clicking on Next Button resets the game.
